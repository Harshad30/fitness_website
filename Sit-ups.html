                1.Lie on a mat, flex your knees, and place your heels on the mat. Engage your core and place your hands at the back of your head. Lift your head and shoulders off the floor and look at the ceiling. This is the starting position.<br>
                2.Use your core strength to lift your body off the floor and come to a sitting position.<br>
                3.Go back down to the starting position slowly. Do 2 sets of 12 reps.<br>

            <h1>What Not To Do:</h1>
            <p>Do not get confused between sit-ups and crunches. You need to literally sit up and go back down to the starting position to do sit-ups. Do not bring your elbows close while sitting up.</p>
