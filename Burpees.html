            <h1>How To Do:</h1>
            <p>
                1.Stand straight with your feet shoulder-width apart.<br>
                2.Bend your knees and place your hands on the floor. Let’s call this the “frog” position for clarity.<br>
                3.Jump and push both your legs back and get into a plank or push-up position.<br>
                4.Hop and get back to the “frog” position.<br>
                5.Jump vertically and extend your hands above your head.<br>
                6.Land softly on the floor.<br>
                7.Get into the frog position again, then go back to the plank position. Do 3 sets of 8 reps. Take a 10-second break between the sets. Also, take a 20-second break before moving on to the next exercise.<br>

            <h1>What Not To Do:</h1>
            <p>Do not set unachievable goals. Burpees are tough to do. The number of burpees you do does not matter. What matters is how many you do while maintaining correct posture.</p>
